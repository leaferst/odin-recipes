    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A nutritious and yummy breakfast made with hashbrowns mixed with bell peppers, a meat of your choice, and cheese topped with a fried egg.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>frozen hashbrowns</li>
        <li>bacon (or anything you want)</li>
        <li>bell peppers; 1 red, 1 yellow, 1 orange</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>cheese(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare two pans, both on medium heat.</li>
        <li>On the first pan, cook a desired amount of bacon.  Flip over periodically and take off as soon as bacon is opaque and bubbles are whiter and frothier.</li>
        <li>In the second pan, heat up some oil until it shimmers.  Cut your bell peppers into small chunks and sautee the bell peppers, flipping periodially until they are slightly darker and color and have a little bit of a visible char.</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is done, soak up some of the grease with a paper towel to throw away and cook the hashbrowns in the rest of the bacon grease.  Fry them in one large piece flipping when bottom is golden brown.</li>
        <li>When the onions are finished, turn the stove down to low and add more oil.  Crack an egg directly into the oil and cover with a lid until all of the egg white is white and opaque.  Flip the egg over at the end for a few seconds if you prefer over-easy versus sunny-side-up.</li>
        <li>Combine all ingredients together; Put the bell peppers and bacon broken into bits on top or mixed in with the hashbrowns and add cheese if you'd like.  Top it with your egg and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
